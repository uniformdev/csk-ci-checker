# TEST Uniform Component Starter Kit

The Component Starter kit gives you the key building blocks to create dynamic and compelling web experiences and demonstrate the power of digital experience composition in Uniform. Just install, customize and start creating.

Built with love by Uniform folks, standing on the shoulders of TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, React and Next.js.

- [Storybook](https://components-storybook.uniform.app/)

## Developer - getting started

### Prerequisites

- A Uniform account with the ability to create a new empty project. If you don't have a Uniform account, you can request a trial account [here](https://uniform.dev/try?utm_source=component-starter-kit).

### Initial setup - via CLI

1. Run `npx @uniformdev/cli new`
1. Pick the "Next.js" / "Component Starter Kit" option and proceed using the prompt.

At the end, you will end up with a locally running starter and Uniform project with all the required content.

### Initial setup - manual

1. Setup your .env file (see .env.example for reference)
   ```bash
   UNIFORM_API_KEY=
   UNIFORM_PROJECT_ID=
   UNIFORM_PREVIEW_SECRET=uniform
   ```
2. `npm install`
3. Run `npm run uniform:push` and `npm run uniform:publish` to push the content from this starter kit (components, compositions and project map) into your project.

### Run locally in dev mode

`npm run dev` to run locally.

### Build and run locally

`npm run build` and `npm start`

## Complete the setup - install the Theme Pack integration

This integration brings Canvas UI extensions for theme management and new useful visual parameters to help control the look and feel of your components.

1. Open your Uniform project.
1. Head over to Settings > Canvas and configure preview to http://your-host/api/preview?secret=uniform
1. Navigate to `Manage Integrations` tab and Install `Theme Pack` integration
1. Select on of the themes or create your own and press `Save`
1. Go to Compositions list, find the "Global" composition and open it in Canvas.
1. In order to apply theme changes, press `Publish` (even if the composition itself is not changed).
   > Optionally, you can change the main font that will be used along with the theme.
   > Here you can also manage your header and footer content - logo and navigation links.

Important: in order to apply theme changes, you must re-publish the "Global" composition after every time you change the `theme` on the integration settings page.
